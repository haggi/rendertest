# rendertest

This repository contains all data which I create for my rendertest project. The idea is to build a system to compare renderengines. Production renderers should offer several features which I will try to test. 

The progress will be documented here: http://renderwiki.haggi.biz/wiki-seiten/testing/testing.php
